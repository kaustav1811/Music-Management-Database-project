# Music-Management-Database-project

üè´ Project Context

- This project was developed as a **Mini Project** for the subject **Database Technologies (DBT)** during the **second year of the AI & Data Science program at DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering**.

- The system is built using:
  - **Python** (for the frontend) with the **Tkinter** library.
  - **MySQL** (for the backend database).

- The application allows users to perform full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on the following music-related entities:
  - Songs
  - Albums
  - Labels
  - Singers
  - Movies
  - Lyrics
  - Tracks
  - Composers
  - Genres
  - Reviews
  - Purchases

- The **Python GUI** provides:
  - A simple, intuitive interface.
  - Button-based access to manage each table.
  - Dynamically generated forms for adding, deleting, and updating records.
  - Table views to display existing data.

- The **MySQL script** includes:
  - Full schema setup with necessary tables.
  - Proper use of **primary keys** and **foreign key constraints**.
  - Pre-inserted sample data and basic queries for testing.

- This project highlights:
  - How **databases can be effectively connected** with GUI applications.
  - The importance of **structured database design**.
  - Practical application of database concepts through a user-friendly interface.

- Overall, the system demonstrates seamless integration between a frontend GUI and a backend relational database, fulfilling the objectives of the **DBT mini project**.
